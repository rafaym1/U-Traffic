# U-Traffic
Traffic Flow Optimization using Graph Neural Networks
# Introduction
This project implements a traffic flow optimization system using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and synthetic traffic data. The system models urban road networks as graphs, where intersections are nodes and roads are edges. It uses PyTorch Geometric for GNN implementation and includes traffic pattern generation with realistic morning and evening peak patterns.

# Features
